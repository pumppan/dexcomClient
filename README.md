# Dexcom Client
Dexcom API Client, with some extra sugar, written in Golang 


### Explanation:
I have a lot of family and friends with Diabetes that have Dexcom CGMs and we love them. We also
wish that we could do more with our years worth of data. I decided to put this together to better
expose their API, since I've had some interesting challenges getting everything working. I'd love to
hear about your projects if you use this API, so feel free to contact me if you end up using this!


### Contribution:
Feel free to shoot me a pull request if you would like to help. I have been doing Go for less
than a year now, so if you would like to help me out by cleaning up the project structure, or adding
better error handling, GO ahead!
